# Spotify API - Playlist Generator

This code isn't currently going to work anywhere but locally.
It is not completely finished on the homepage either, meaning the user has to click two buttons for me to gain access to their account.
I manually implemented the authentication path which was probably not optimal, I should've used something like Next Auth which I didn't know existed at the time I created it.

This was also my first project written in "typescript"... Quotation marks because I did not use it properly as I didn't know how to, meaning it contains a lot of any types and no interfaces :P.
